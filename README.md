We ship a lot of code at Hyper, and we're proud of every bit of it. We built this simple application to
select random commits for review whenever we push code so we can show it off or
ridicule [@espenhogbakk](https://github.com/espenhogbakk) whenever he version controls his passwords.

## Usage

Create a post-receive hook to hit your code review application and specify the service you're using
in the `service` parameter (e.g. `http://review.example.org?service=github`).

## Configuration

The application looks to the following environment variables for its configuration:

* `SENDER` - A string describing the sender's name and email address (e.g `Hyper <no-reply@hyper.no>`).
* `ODDS` - A string of the format "x:y" that describes the likelihood that a commit will be selected for review (e.g. `1:25`).
* `REVIEWERS` - A comma-separated list of e-mail addresses that code reviews may be addressed to (e.g. `john@work.com,jane@work.com`).
* `SMTP_HOST` - A string describing the SMTP host.
* `SMTP_PORT` - A string describing the SMTP port.
* `SMTP_DOMAIN` - A string describing the SMTP domain.
* `SMTP_USERNAME` - A string describing the SMTP username.
* `SMTP_PASSWORD` - A string describing the SMTP password.
* `GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN` - A string describing a GitLab private token.
* `GUARANTEED_REVIEW` - A string that will automatically qualify commits for review (defaults to `please review`).

## Development

Install the dependencies:

    $ bundle install

Run the tests:

    $ bundle exec rake test

Run the server:

    $ bundle exec rackup

## Credits

Hyper made this. We're a digital communications agency with a passion for good code,
and if you're using this application we probably want to hire you.
